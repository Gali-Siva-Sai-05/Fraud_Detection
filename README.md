# Fraud Detection System

🚀 A Machine Learning project to detect fraudulent transactions in financial datasets.  
The goal is to build models that can accurately classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **legitimate**, even with imbalanced data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Performed **data preprocessing** including handling missing values, class imbalance. 
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand transaction patterns and correlations.  
- Implemented **classification algorithms**:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - XGBoost  
- Evaluated models using metrics suited for imbalanced datasets:
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Visualized fraud vs non-fraud distributions and **feature importance** to interpret results.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost  

---

## 📊 Results
- Achieved high precision and recall scores with ensemble methods.  
- ROC-AUC score demonstrated strong model performance on imbalanced data.  
- Feature importance highlighted key attributes influencing fraud detection.
